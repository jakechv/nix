pair existing devices
* DONE networking
CLOSED: [2020-07-19 Sun 06:19]
ensure the device can properly connect to local network
* TODO Make vim config identical to emacs config
vim should have a subset of the emacs commands and features
but it should have the same keybindings for the same operations, generally
* TODO incorporate more advanced exwm config
https://github.com/jethrokuan/dots/blob/master/.doom.d/modules/desktop/exwm/config.el
* TODO enforce firefox one window per tab
this probably has to be handled in counsel-search and browse-url-firefox
is it worth it? it definitely makes things more consisten... borrow from jethro's configuration
* TODO add Nord GTK theme
* TODO update firefox theme to match Nord
