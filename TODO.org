* TODO input mapping
ensure capslock -> mod/esc works
allow tap-to-click on trackpad
consider some of kyles fancy file input things
* DONE bluetooth
CLOSED: [2020-08-20 Thu 00:34]
ensure bluetoothctl is configured
pair existing devices
* DONE networking
CLOSED: [2020-07-19 Sun 06:19]
ensure the device can properly connect to local network
* TODO Make vim config identical to emacs config
vim should have a subset of the emacs commands and features
but it should have the same keybindings for the same operations, generally
any trans-window navigation should be bridged with tmux as well
* TODO incorporate more advanced exwm config
https://github.com/jethrokuan/dots/blob/master/.doom.d/modules/desktop/exwm/config.el
* DONE enforce firefox one window per tab
CLOSED: [2020-07-20 Mon 17:53]
this probably has to be handled in counsel-search and browse-url-firefox
is it worth it? it definitely makes things more consisten... borrow from jethro's configuration
* TODO add Nord GTK theme
* TODO let s-* keyboard shortcuts through in the firefox mode
org-capture should work independent of mode
* DONE emacs :: make a org capture template to save a link and add a note to it
CLOSED: [2020-07-20 Mon 17:51]
* DONE emacs :: block audio ctrl and f-keys from firefox
CLOSED: [2020-07-20 Mon 17:51]
* TODO emacs :: hopefully make config literate at some point!
this is good for documentation and for ensuring the code is good quality
* TODO add the server component
its mostly here,
just have to learn to use nixops to deploy
* TODO refine organization
this repo isn't very well organized now, it should be refactored
to make use of better abstraction and reusability.
it should also have a more clearly defined structure
* TODO cachix
configure builds to run after commits to ensure that the
configuration is still okay, making use of CI.
* TODO add a new flow for creating a new project
ask for a project name.
1. create git repo in home dir with project name
2. assoc. with public github repo with same name
3. lorri init
4. niv init -- is niv necessary? it seems like too much.
5. direnv allow
6. (ensure lorri or nix-shell is hooked up with editor)
7. open shell.nix file for editing
8. (hot reload based on changes in shell.nix?)
* CANCELLED figure out how to install emacs packages in shell.nix

  not a good idea, not everyone uses emacs lol
:END:
not sure if this is a good idea because people have different editor opinions
but if everyone uses emacs it seems super nice to auto install
the correct emacs packages for interfacing with the code when codin
* integrate parts of this setup
https://christine.website/blog/how-i-start-nix-2020-03-08
* TODO swap to zfs
i can add autoshapshots pretty easily!!
i do have to reformat everything to use ZFS in order to make this work, though.
#+begin_src nix
services.zfs = {
    autoSnapshot = {
      enable = true;
      monthly = 1; # keep only one monthly instead of 12
    };
    autoScrub = {
      enable = true;
      interval = "monthly";
    };
  };
#+end_src
* TODO add ssh keys
adding public authorized keys seems good, at least for the pi
this way i can add the keys ahead of time (in private)
and have them available to all devices
#+begin_src nix
users.extraUsers.jake.openssh.authorizedKeys.keys = [
    "ssh-rsa ....."
  ];
#+end_src
* TODO wifi connection flow
1. poll wifi networks
2. allow for the selection of a wifi network (via networkmanager)
3. determine whether wi fi is sending u to default landing page for all websites (ping google, ddg, etc)
4. if so, open the site in firefox. else, do nothing -- good to go
* DONE zsh in nix-shell
CLOSED: [2020-08-19 Wed 08:59]
- prompt should change color to indicate we are living in a shell
- should have autocomplete for things available to us in the shell
- fzf should work (aaahhh)
- --pure flag should still leave us with a usable shell.
  it may be a good idea to create a default shell.nix with devtools and preferences for them
  that can be added to the projects i'm working on.
  others could import their own personal shell file to have their preferred dev tools accessible
* TODO remove the stupid white bar in firefox
why is this there! it's obnoxious!
* TODO ripgrep vs ag
configure one of them with sensible defaults
* TODO add snippets
see what i do the most and make snippets for those componetns
* TODO move between workspaces with right and left
catch the error of last page
see if there is one visible on the other monitor (hardcode the position?)
if there is, switch to the rightmost or leftmost buffer on that monitor rather than
not switching at all
* TODO proper scaling of device when plugged in and unplugged
ideally i would like the xps to take full advantage of 4k, at least when unplugged
this may not be possible though
not even sure if i want the screen to be on
* TODO instead of opening the site with the same title twice, switch to a currently open buffer with that title
rewrite a browse-url function to accomplish this!
is there any way this could go wrong?
* TODO make a custom start page
the default one is boring and looks like everyone else's!
* TODO add email configuration
