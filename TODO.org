  i am okay not having mod on that key
  and it could take a lot of wokr to get that done
:END:
** DONE allow tap-to-click on trackpad
CLOSED: [2020-08-25 Tue 16:05]
** TODO consider some of kyles fancy file input things
* DONE bluetooth
CLOSED: [2020-08-20 Thu 00:34]
ensure bluetoothctl is configured
pair existing devices
* DONE networking
CLOSED: [2020-07-19 Sun 06:19]
ensure the device can properly connect to local network
* TODO Make vim config identical to emacs config
vim should have a subset of the emacs commands and features
but it should have the same keybindings for the same operations, generally
any trans-window navigation should be bridged with tmux as well
* TODO incorporate more advanced exwm config
https://github.com/jethrokuan/dots/blob/master/.doom.d/modules/desktop/exwm/config.el
* DONE enforce firefox one window per tab
CLOSED: [2020-07-20 Mon 17:53]
this probably has to be handled in counsel-search and browse-url-firefox
is it worth it? it definitely makes things more consisten... borrow from jethro's configuration
* TODO add Nord GTK theme
somewhat done, i added the nord X theme...
* TODO let s-* keyboard shortcuts through in the firefox mode
org-capture should work independent of mode
* DONE emacs :: make a org capture template to save a link and add a note to it
CLOSED: [2020-07-20 Mon 17:51]
* DONE emacs :: block audio ctrl and f-keys from firefox
CLOSED: [2020-07-20 Mon 17:51]

  literate config isn't super important

  it's cool to be able to publish the config on a website
  and run the config,

  but it's more interesting when there is more content.

  come back to this when i have more progress made
:END:
this is good for documentation and for ensuring the code is good quality
* TODO add the server component
its mostly here,
just have to learn to use nixops to deploy
* TODO refine organization
this repo isn't very well organized now, it should be refactored
to make use of better abstraction and reusability.
it should also have a more clearly defined structure
* TODO cachix
configure builds to run after commits to ensure that the
configuration is still okay, making use of CI.
* TODO add a new flow for creating a new project
ask for a project name.
1. create git repo in home dir with project name
2. assoc. with public github repo with same name
3. lorri init
4. niv init -- is niv necessary? it seems like too much.
5. direnv allow
6. (ensure lorri or nix-shell is hooked up with editor)
7. open shell.nix file for editing
8. (hot reload based on changes in shell.nix?)
* CANCELLED figure out how to install emacs packages in shell.nix

  not a good idea, not everyone uses emacs lol
:END:
not sure if this is a good idea because people have different editor opinions
but if everyone uses emacs it seems super nice to auto install
the correct emacs packages for interfacing with the code when codin
* integrate parts of this setup
https://christine.website/blog/how-i-start-nix-2020-03-08
* TODO swap to zfs
i can add autoshapshots pretty easily!!
i do have to reformat everything to use ZFS in order to make this work, though.
#+begin_src nix
services.zfs = {
    autoSnapshot = {
      enable = true;
      monthly = 1; # keep only one monthly instead of 12
    };
    autoScrub = {
      enable = true;
      interval = "monthly";
    };
  };
#+end_src
* TODO add ssh keys
adding public authorized keys seems good, at least for the pi
this way i can add the keys ahead of time (in private)
and have them available to all devices
#+begin_src nix
users.extraUsers.jake.openssh.authorizedKeys.keys = [
    "ssh-rsa ....."
  ];
#+end_src
* TODO wifi connection flow
1. poll wifi networks
2. allow for the selection of a wifi network (via networkmanager)
3. determine whether wi fi is sending u to default landing page for all websites (ping google, ddg, etc)
4. if so, open the site in firefox. else, do nothing -- good to go
* DONE zsh in nix-shell
CLOSED: [2020-08-19 Wed 08:59]
- prompt should change color to indicate we are living in a shell
- should have autocomplete for things available to us in the shell
- fzf should work (aaahhh)
- --pure flag should still leave us with a usable shell.
  it may be a good idea to create a default shell.nix with devtools and preferences for them
  that can be added to the projects i'm working on.
  others could import their own personal shell file to have their preferred dev tools accessible
* TODO remove the stupid white bar in firefox
why is this there! it's obnoxious!
* TODO get 'pass' properly working and syncing with everything
* DONE ripgrep vs ag
CLOSED: [2020-08-25 Tue 15:59]
configure one of them with sensible defaults
ripgrep is just faster
* TODO add snippets
see what i do the most and make snippets for those componetns
* TODO move between workspaces with right and left
catch the error of last page
see if there is one visible on the other monitor (hardcode the position?)
if there is, switch to the rightmost or leftmost buffer on that monitor rather than
not switching at all
* TODO proper scaling of device when plugged in and unplugged
ideally i would like the xps to take full advantage of 4k, at least when unplugged
this may not be possible though
not even sure if i want the screen to be on
* CANCELLED instead of opening the site with the same title twice, switch to a currently open buffer with that title

:LOGBOOK:
- State "CANCELLED"  from "TODO"       [2020-09-04 Fri 09:55] \\
  Different websites could have the same title. this is silly
:END:
rewrite a browse-url function to accomplish this!
is there any way this could go wrong?
* DONE make a custom start page for emacs
CLOSED: [2020-09-17 Thu 23:50]
the default one is boring and looks like everyone else's!
* TODO add email configuration
https://tecosaur.github.io/emacs-config/config.html
* TODO add firefox extensions
- extension for translating information
- extension for react dev tools (is there a way for me to add this to a shell somehow?)
- password manager. (pref. lastpass)
* DONE add f/F keyboard shortcut to firefox
CLOSED: [2020-09-04 Fri 09:54]
i want to be able to click on links without using the mouse again
* TODO if a buffer is opened in a project, change its name to the name of the project
example:
SPC-o-T in Pumbaa :: 'Term :: Pumbaa(1)' is the second terminal opened up in the Pumbaa project.
* CANCELLED add flycheck checkers for more types of files

  doing everything locally is just better
:END:
json, html, css globally would be nice
could also be nice per project
consider installing node, yarn and eslint_d globally,
then locally installing things like postgres
* CANCELLED add tide

- State "CANCELLED"  from "TODO"       [2020-09-17 Thu 23:47] \\
  working just fine with the tide config built into doom
:END:
much better javascript performance; easy to set up.
check email for a link regarding better emacs setup
* TODO grey out all text if a task is finished
currently things are highlighted under DONE bullets
i want to completely gray them out
* TODO make shell commands run async
currently shell command convenience function for sudo commands to open in buffer runs everything synchronously
this seems ok until emacs freezes for two minutes running nixos-rebuild
rebuilding nixos should use the same procedure doom emacs does for rebuilding:
- open minibuffer
- Run doom rebuild process async
- display output in minibuffer as it happens
this avoids interrupting current work
