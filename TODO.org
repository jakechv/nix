* TODO input mapping
ensure capslock -> mod/esc works
allow tap-to-click on trackpad
consider some of kyles fancy file input things
* TODO bluetooth
ensure bluetoothctl is configured
pair existing devices
* DONE networking
CLOSED: [2020-07-19 Sun 06:19]
ensure the device can properly connect to local network
* TODO Make vim config identical to emacs config
vim should have a subset of the emacs commands and features
but it should have the same keybindings for the same operations, generally
any trans-window navigation should be bridged with tmux as well
* TODO incorporate more advanced exwm config
https://github.com/jethrokuan/dots/blob/master/.doom.d/modules/desktop/exwm/config.el
* DONE enforce firefox one window per tab
CLOSED: [2020-07-20 Mon 17:53]
this probably has to be handled in counsel-search and browse-url-firefox
is it worth it? it definitely makes things more consisten... borrow from jethro's configuration
* TODO add Nord GTK theme
* TODO let s-* keyboard shortcuts through in the firefox mode
org-capture should work independent of mode
* DONE emacs :: make a org capture template to save a link and add a note to it
CLOSED: [2020-07-20 Mon 17:51]
* DONE emacs :: block audio ctrl and f-keys from firefox
CLOSED: [2020-07-20 Mon 17:51]
* TODO emacs :: hopefully make config literate at some point!
this is good for documentation and for ensuring the code is good quality
* TODO add the server component
its mostly here,
just have to learn to use nixops to deploy
* TODO refine organization
this repo isn't very well organized now, it should be refactored
to make use of better abstraction and reusability.
it should also have a more clearly defined structure
* TODO cachix
configure builds to run after commits to ensure that the
configuration is still okay, making use of CI.
* TODO add a new flow for creating a new package
1. create git repo in home dir
2. assoc. with public github repo
3. lorri init
4. niv init
5. direnv allow
6. (ensure lorri or nix-shell is hooked up with editor)
7. open shell.nix file for editing
8. (hot reload based on changes in shell.nix?)
* CANCELLED figure out how to install emacs packages in shell.nix

  not a good idea, not everyone uses emacs lol
:END:
not sure if this is a good idea because people have different editor opinions
but if everyone uses emacs it seems super nice to auto install
the correct emacs packages for interfacing with the code when codin
* integrate parts of this setup
https://christine.website/blog/how-i-start-nix-2020-03-08
* TODO swap to zfs
i can add autoshapshots pretty easily!!
#+begin_src nix
services.zfs = {
    autoSnapshot = {
      enable = true;
      monthly = 1; # keep only one monthly instead of 12
    };
    autoScrub = {
      enable = true;
      interval = "monthly";
    };
  };
#+end_src
* TODO add ssh keys
adding public authorized keys seems good, at least for the pi
#+begin_src nix
users.extraUsers.jake.openssh.authorizedKeys.keys = [
    "ssh-rsa ....."
  ];
#+end_src
* TODO wifi connection flow
1. poll wifi networks
2. allow for the selection of a wifi network (via networkmanager)
3. determine whether wi fi is sending u to default landing page for all websites (ping google, ddg, etc)
4. if so, open the site in firefox. else, do nothing -- good to go
* TODO zsh in nix-shell
- prompt should change color to indicate we are living in a shell
- should have autocomplete for things available to us in the shell
- fzf should work (aaahhh)
- --pure flag should still leave us with a usable shell.
  it may be a good idea to create a default shell.nix with devtools and preferences for them
  that can be added to the projects i'm working on.
  others could import their own personal shell file to have their preferred dev tools accessible
