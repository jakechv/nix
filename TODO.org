#+TITLE: Todo
* [1/12] create separate installation frameworks
** DONE emacs:
CLOSED: [2020-07-19 Sun 06:19]
   - exwm
   - firefox
   ... that's about it
** [0/6] headless:
*** TODO vim
*** TODO tmux
*** TODO ranger
*** TODO newsboat
*** TODO mutt
*** TODO shell aliases and config
** [0/5] 'normal' desktop:
*** TODO bspwm
*** TODO thunar
*** TODO firefox
*** TODO other gui apps
*** TODO consistent color scheme

* TODO input mapping
ensure capslock -> mod/esc works
allow tap-to-click on trackpad
consider some of kyles fancy file input things
* TODO bluetooth
ensure bluetoothctl is configured
pair existing devices
* DONE networking
CLOSED: [2020-07-19 Sun 06:19]
ensure the device can properly connect to local network
* TODO Make vim config identical to emacs config
vim should have a subset of the emacs commands and features
but it should have the same keybindings for the same operations, generally
any trans-window navigation should be bridged with tmux as well
* TODO incorporate more advanced exwm config
https://github.com/jethrokuan/dots/blob/master/.doom.d/modules/desktop/exwm/config.el
* DONE enforce firefox one window per tab
CLOSED: [2020-07-20 Mon 17:53]
this probably has to be handled in counsel-search and browse-url-firefox
is it worth it? it definitely makes things more consisten... borrow from jethro's configuration
* TODO add Nord GTK theme
* TODO let s-* keyboard shortcuts through in the firefox mode
org-capture should work independent of mode
* DONE emacs :: make a org capture template to save a link and add a note to it
CLOSED: [2020-07-20 Mon 17:51]
* DONE emacs :: block audio ctrl and f-keys from firefox
CLOSED: [2020-07-20 Mon 17:51]
* TODO emacs :: hopefully make config literate at some point!
this is good for documentation and for ensuring the code is good quality
* TODO add the server component
its mostly here,
just have to learn to use nixops to deploy
* TODO refine organization
this repo isn't very well organized now, it should be refactored
to make use of better abstraction and reusability.
it should also have a more clearly defined structure
* TODO cachix
configure builds to run after commits to ensure that the
configuration is still okay, making use of CI.
