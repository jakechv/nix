#+TITLE: Nixos Install

these are nixos install notes

i had to:
- login as root
 passwd {username}
 set password for username
 then i could log in as normal user
 chown -hR jake /etc/nixos
 then git clone into it from my nix-cfg repo

* TODO reproducible git configuration
* TODO make sure everything is backed up on this computer before i install elsewhere
